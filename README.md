# AI generated orienteering routes

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project is about building an AI to generate orienteering training courses based on the orienteering world cup routes. We gather data from the various world cup competitions and try to delegate the course set to the AI.


## Background

Orienteering course setting takes time in the forest and on the computer screen. Sometimes courses need a lot of tiny adjustments. There are many things to delegate to the AI and workflows that could be easy to automate. To make a good training course, you will need many years of knowledge and experience in the course setting. The final project could save a lot of time and bring more joy to the self-training.


## How is it used?

The user would upload the base map to the web service and select the difficulty, length, number of checkpoints, and additional settings of the final map. Then the AI solution would generate a world-class training map, which the user could go and test. If the user wants to adjust the training map, the service saves the map as a draft, and the user can come and edit it afterward.


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
